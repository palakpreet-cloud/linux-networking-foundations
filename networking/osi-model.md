### 1. Physical Layer
Handles physical transmission of data (cables, signals).

### 2. Data Link Layer
Responsible for MAC addresses and error detection.

### 3. Network Layer
Handles IP addressing and routing.

### 4. Transport Layer
Ensures reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP).

### 5. Session Layer
Manages communication sessions between systems.
